Title: About
sortorder: 10

This site is maintained by [Aaron
Bloomfield](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb), and is kept in the
[uva-cs/ugrads.cs github
repository](https://github.com/uva-cs/ugrads.cs).

Faculty can request to be allowed to directly edit the contents of the
git repo: either via git, or editing online via github.com.  Students
can suggest changes by submitting a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

The actual HTML pages are built using
[Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) version 3.7.1, and the source is in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
However, one does not need to have Pelican installed to edit the site,
as the [http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu](http://ugrads.cs.virginia.edu)
site is automatically rebuilt every time content in the git repo is
changed on github.com.  Should you want to build the pages on your
local machine, look at the [Pelican quickstart
guide](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.7.1/quickstart.html).
